# CMake Template for VST Audio Plug-ins

This is a [CMake][cmake] template for developing VST2.4 audio plug-ins on
Windows, OS X, and Linux. Simply changing the ``CMakeLists.txt`` to point to
your VST SDK will be sufficient to build the classic "AGain" sample project.
This template has support for Visual Studio projects, Xcode projects, and
standard Makefile projects.
